message: Many Ruby on Rails apps are open source and hosted on publicly available
  source code repositories. Whether that is the case or the code is committed to a
  corporate source control system, there are certain files that should be either excluded
  or carefully managed.
remediation: Put sensitive files in your repository gitignore file
