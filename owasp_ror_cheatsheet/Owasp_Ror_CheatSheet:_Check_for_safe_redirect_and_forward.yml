  Web applications often require the ability to dynamically redirect users based
  on client-supplied data. To clarify, dynamic redirection usually entails the
  client including a URL in a parameter within a request to the application. Once
  received by the application, the user is redirected to the URL specified in the
  request.

  For example: http://www.example.com/redirect?url=http://www.example_commerce_site.com/checkout

  The above request would redirect the user to http://www.example.com/checkout.

  The security concern associated with this functionality is leveraging an
  organization's trusted brand to phish users and trick them into visiting a
  malicious site, in our example, "badhacker.com".

  Example: http://www.example.com/redirect?url=http://badhacker.com

  The most basic, but restrictive protection is to use the :only_path option.
  Setting this to true will essentially strip out any host information.
