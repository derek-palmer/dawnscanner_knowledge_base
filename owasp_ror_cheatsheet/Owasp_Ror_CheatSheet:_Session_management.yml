message: By default, Ruby on Rails uses a Cookie based session store. What that means
  is that unless you change something, the session will not expire on the server.
  That means that some default applications may be vulnerable to replay attacks. It
  also means that sensitive information should never be put in the session.
remediation: Use ActiveRecord or the ORM you love most to handle your code session_store.
  Add "Application.config.session_store :active_record_store" to your session_store.rb
  file.

evidences:
- In your session_store.rb file you are not using ActiveRecord to store session data.
  This will let rails to use a cookie based session and it can expose your web application
  to a session replay attack.
