message: Although the major issue with Mass Assignment has been fixed by default in
  base Rails specifically when generating new projects, it still applies to older
  and upgraded projects so it is important to understand the issue and to ensure that
  only attributes that are intended to be modifiable are exposed.
remediation: Avoid attr_accessor attribute modifier in your models. You must use attr_reader
  as modifier and carefully filter your inputs before passing to the database layer.

evidences:
- In one or more of your models, you use attr_accessor attribute modifier. This is
  risky since it exposes you to a massive assignment vulnerability. You have to carefully
  handle how your model receive data by setting all attribute to attr_reader and using
  a setter method validating input before saving to database.
