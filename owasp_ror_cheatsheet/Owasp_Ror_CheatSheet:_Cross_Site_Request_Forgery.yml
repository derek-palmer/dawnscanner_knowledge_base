message: Ruby on Rails has specific, built in support for CSRF tokens. To enable it,
  or ensure that it is enabled, find the base ApplicationController and look for the
  protect_from_forgery directive. Note that by default Rails does not provide CSRF
  protection for any HTTP GET request.
remediation: Make sure you are using Rails protect_from_forgery facilities in application_controller.rMake
  sure you are using Rails protect_from_forgery facilities in application_controller.rb
