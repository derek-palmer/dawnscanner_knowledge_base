message: 'Ruby offers a function called "eval" which will dynamically build new Ruby
  code based on Strings. It also has a number of ways to call system commands. While
  the power of these commands is quite useful, extreme care should be taken when using
  them in a Rails based application. Usually, its just a bad idea. If need be, a whitelist
  of possible values should be used and any input should be validated as thoroughly
  as possible. The Ruby Security Reviewer''s Guide has a section on injection and
  there are a number of OWASP references for it, starting at the top: Command Injection.'
remediation: Please validate the code you pass as argument to eval, System, Kernel.exec
  and friends. If you generate your command line with user controlled values, can
  lead to an arbitrary code execution.
