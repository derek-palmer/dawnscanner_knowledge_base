message: Unspecified vulnerability in the "dependency resolution mechanism" in Ruby
  on Rails 1.1.0 through 1.1.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Ruby code
  via a URL that is not properly handled in the routing code, which leads to a denial
  of service (application hang) or "data loss," a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-4111.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 1.1.6 or higher. As a general
  rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
