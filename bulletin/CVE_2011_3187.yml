message: The to_s method in actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/remote_ip.rb
  in Ruby on Rails 3.0.5 does not validate the X-Forwarded-For header in requests
  from IP addresses on a Class C network, which might allow remote attackers to inject
  arbitrary text into log files or bypass intended address parsing via a crafted header.
remediation: Please upgrade rails to version 3.0.6. As a general rule, using the latest
  stable version is recommended.
