message: ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.17 and 3.x before 3.1.0 allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via crafted serialized
  attributes that cause the +serialize+ helper to deserialize arbitrary YAML.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 2.3.17 and 3.1.0. As a general
  rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
