message: 'Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking, which
  makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the values of random
  numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number sequence obtained in a different child
  process, a related issue to CVE-2003-0900. NOTE: this issue exists because of a
  regression during Ruby 1.8.6 development.'
remediation: Please upgrade ruby interpreter to 1.8.7-p352 or latest version available
