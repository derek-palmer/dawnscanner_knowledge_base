message: The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x before 2.3.18, 3.1.x before
  3.1.12, and 3.2.x before 3.2.13 processes certain queries by converting hash keys
  to symbols, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via crafted
  input to a where method.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 2.3.18, 3.1.12 and 3.2.13. As
  a general rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
