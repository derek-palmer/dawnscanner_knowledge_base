message: SQL injection vulnerability in the Active Record component in Ruby on Rails
  before 3.0.18, 3.1.x before 3.1.9, and 3.2.x before 3.2.10 allows remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a crafted request that leverages incorrect
  behavior of dynamic finders in applications that can use unexpected data types in
  certain find_by_ method calls.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 3.2.10, 3.1.9 or 3.0.18. As
  a general rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
