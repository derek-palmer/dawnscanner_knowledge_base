message: The extract_files function in installer.rb in RubyGems before 0.9.1 does
  not check whether files exist before overwriting them, which allows user-assisted
  remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, or execute
  arbitrary code via crafted GEM packages.
remediation: This vulnerability should never occur due to the rubygem evolution. However
  if it has been found, please upgrade your whole development environment ot something
  newer
