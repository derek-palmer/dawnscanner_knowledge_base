message: The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.13, 3.1.x before
  3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not properly implement the passing of request
  data to a where method in an ActiveRecord class, which allows remote attackers to
  conduct certain SQL injection attacks via nested query parameters that leverage
  unintended recursion, a related issue to CVE-2012-2695.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 3.2.5, 3.1.5 or 3.0.13. As a
  general rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
