message: The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails before 3.0.14, 3.1.x before
  3.1.6, and 3.2.x before 3.2.6 does not properly implement the passing of request
  data to a where method in an ActiveRecord class, which allows remote attackers to
  conduct certain SQL injection attacks via nested query parameters that leverage
  improper handling of nested hashes, a related issue to CVE-2012-2661.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 3.2.6, 3.1.6 or 3.0.14. As a
  general rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
