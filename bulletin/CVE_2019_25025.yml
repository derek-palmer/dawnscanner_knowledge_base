kind: :dependency_check
message: |-
  The activerecord-session_store (aka Active Record Session Store) component
  through 1.1.3 for Ruby on Rails does not use a constant-time approach when
  delivering information about whether a guessed session ID is valid.
  Consequently, remote attackers can leverage timing discrepancies to achieve a
  correct guess in a relatively short amount of time. This is a related issue
  to CVE-2019-16782.
remediation: Update to 2.0.0 gem version
