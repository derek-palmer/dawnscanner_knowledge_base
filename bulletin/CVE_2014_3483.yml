message: Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that may allow carrying out an SQL injection
  attack. The issue is due to the PostgreSQL adapter for Active Record not properly
  sanitizing user-supplied input when quoting ranges. This may allow a remote attacker
  to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database, allowing for the manipulation
  or disclosure of arbitrary data.
remediation: Please upgrade rails at least to version 4.0.7 or 4.1.3. As a general
  rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
