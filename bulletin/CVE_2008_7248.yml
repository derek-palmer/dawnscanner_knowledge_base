message: Ruby on Rails 2.1 before 2.1.3 and 2.2.x before 2.2.2 does not verify tokens
  for requests with certain content types, which allows remote attackers to bypass
  cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection for requests to applications that rely
  on this protection, as demonstrated using text/plain.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 2.1.3 or 2.2.2 or higher. As
  a general rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
