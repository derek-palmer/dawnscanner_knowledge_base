message: The Authlogic gem for Ruby on Rails, when used with certain versions before
  3.2.10, makes potentially unsafe find_by_id method calls, which might allow remote
  attackers to conduct CVE-2012-6496 SQL injection attacks via a crafted parameter
  in environments that have a known secret_token value, as demonstrated by a value
  contained in secret_token.rb in an open-source product.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version to the latest stable rails version.
