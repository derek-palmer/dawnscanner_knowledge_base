kind: :dependency_check
message: refile Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when input is not sanitized
  when handling the 'remote_image_url' field in a form, where 'image' is the name
  of the attachment. This may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands.
remediation: Please upgrade refile gem to version 0.5.4 or later.
