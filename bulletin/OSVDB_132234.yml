title: rack-attack Gem for Ruby missing normalization before request path processing

message: 'When using rack-attack with a rails app, developers expect the request path
  to be normalized. In particular, trailing slashes are stripped so a request path
  "/login/" becomes "/login" by the time you''re in ActionController. Since Rack::Attack
  runs before ActionDispatch, the request path is not yet normalized. This can cause
  throttles and blacklists to not work as expected. E.g., a throttle: throttle(''logins'',
  ...) {|req| req.path == "/login" } would not match a request to ''/login/'', though
  Rails would route ''/login/'' to the same ''/login'' action.'
remediation: Please upgrade rack-attack gem to version 4.3.1 or later.
