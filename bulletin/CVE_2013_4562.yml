kind: :dependency_check
message: Because of the way that omniauth-facebook supports setting a per-request
  state parameter by storing it in the session, it is possible to circumvent the automatic
  CSRF protection. Therefore the CSRF added in 1.4.1 should be considered broken.
  If you are currently providing a custom state, you will need to store and retrieve
  this yourself (for example, by using the session store) to use 1.5.0.
remediation: You must upgrade at least to 1.5.0 or later
