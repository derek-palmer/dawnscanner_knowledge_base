kind: :ruby_version_check
message: "** DISPUTED ** Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation functionality
  in Ruby 1.9.3-p194, when installed in the top-level C: directory, might allow local
  users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in the C:Ruby193\bin directory,
  which may be added to the PATH system environment variable by an administrator,
  as demonstrated by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file used by the \"IKE and AuthIP
  IPsec Keying Modules\" system service in Windows Vista SP1, Windows Server 2008
  SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview. NOTE: CVE disputes this issue
  because the unsafe PATH is established only by a separate administrative action
  that is not a default part of the Ruby installation."
remediation: Upgrade ruby to the latest 1.9.3 patch or even better use ruby 2.x
