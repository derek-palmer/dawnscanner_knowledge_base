message: The nori gem 2.0.x before 2.0.2, 1.1.x before 1.1.4, and 1.0.x before 1.0.3
  for Ruby does not properly restrict casts of string values, which allows remote
  attackers to conduct object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause
  a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) involving nested XML entity references,
  by leveraging Action Pack support for (1) YAML type conversion or (2) Symbol type
  conversion, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
remediation: Please upgrade nori gem to version 2.0.2, 1.1.4, 1.0.3 or latest version
  available
