message: 'The session fixation protection mechanism in cgi_process.rb in Rails 1.2.4,
  as used in Ruby on Rails, removes the :cookie_only attribute from the DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS
  constant, which effectively causes cookie_only to be applied only to the first instantiation
  of CgiRequest, which allows remote attackers to conduct session fixation attacks.
  NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-5380. It has been reviewed in
  2012 and it affects also 2.3.x, 3.0.x and 3.1.x.'
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 1.2.7, 2.1.3, 2.3.13, 3.0.15,
  3.1.7, 3.2.7 or higher. As a general rule, using the latest stable rails version
  is recommended.
