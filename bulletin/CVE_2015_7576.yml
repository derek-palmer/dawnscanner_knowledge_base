message: There is a timing attack vulnerability in the basic authentication support
  in Action Controller. Due to the way that Action Controller compares user names
  and passwords in basic authentication authorization code, it is possible for an
  attacker to analyze the time taken by a response and intuit the password.
remediation: Please upgrade actionpack gem to version 3.2.22.1, 4.1.14.1, 4.2.5.1,
  5.0.0.beta1.1 or later.
