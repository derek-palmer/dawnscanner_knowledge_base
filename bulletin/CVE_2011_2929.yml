message: The template selection functionality in actionpack/lib/action_view/template/resolver.rb
  in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.10 and 3.1.x before 3.1.0.rc6 does not properly
  handle glob characters, which allows remote attackers to render arbitrary views
  via a crafted URL, related to a "filter skipping vulnerability."
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 3.1.0 or 3.0.10. As a general
  rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
