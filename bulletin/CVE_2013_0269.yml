message: The JSON gem before 1.5.5, 1.6.x before 1.6.8, and 1.7.x before 1.7.7 for
  Ruby allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption)
  or bypass the mass assignment protection mechanism via a crafted JSON document that
  triggers the creation of arbitrary Ruby symbols or certain internal objects, as
  demonstrated by conducting a SQL injection attack against Ruby on Rails, aka "Unsafe
  Object Creation Vulnerability."
remediation: Please upgrade JSON gem to version 1.5.5, 1.6.8 or 1.7.7 or latest version
  available
