message: There is a XSS vulnerability in Rails::Html::FullSanitizer used by Action
  View's strip_tags. Due to the way that Rails::Html::FullSanitizer is implemented,
  if an attacker passes an already escaped HTML entity to the input of Action View's
  strip_tags these entities will be unescaped what may cause a XSS attack if used
  in combination with raw or html_safe.
remediation: Please upgrade rails-html-sanitizer to version 1.0.3 or later.
