message: ruby-saml contains a flaw that is triggered as the URI value of a SAML response
  is not properly sanitized through a prepared statement. This may allow a remote
  attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the host machine.
remediation: Please upgrade ruby-saml gem to version 0.8.2 or later.
