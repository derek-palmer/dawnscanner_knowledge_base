message: actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb in Ruby on Rails before 3.0.14,
  3.1.x before 3.1.6, and 3.2.x before 3.2.6 does not properly consider differences
  in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the Rack interface,
  which allows remote attackers to bypass intended database-query restrictions and
  perform NULL checks via a crafted request, as demonstrated by certain "['xyz', nil]"
  values, a related issue to CVE-2012-2660.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 2.3.15, 3.2.6, 3.1.6 or 3.0.14.
  As a general rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
