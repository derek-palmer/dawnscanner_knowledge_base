release_date: 2012-11-28
kind: :ruby_version_check
message: JRuby computes hash values without properly restricting the ability to trigger
  hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
  denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains
  a hash table, as demonstrated by a universal multicollision attack against the MurmurHash2
  algorithm, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4838.
remediation: At the moment we're writing this (May 2013) there is no mitigation against
  this vulnerability. You must consider changing your hashing algorithm
