message: redcarpet gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the parse_inline() function in markdown.c
  does not validate input before returning it to users. This may allow a remote attacker
  to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in
  a user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and
  the server.
remediation: Please upgrade redcarpet gem to version 3.2.3 or later.
