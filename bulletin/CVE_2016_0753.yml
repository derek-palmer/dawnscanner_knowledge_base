message: There is a possible input validation circumvention vulnerability in Active
  Model. Code that uses Active Model based models (including Active Record models)
  and does not validate user input before passing it to the model can be subject to
  an attack where specially crafted input will cause the model to skip validations.
remediation: Please upgrade activemodel gem to version 3.2.22.1, 4.1.14.1, 4.2.5.1,
  5.0.0.beta1.1 or later.
