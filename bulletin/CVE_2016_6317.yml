title: Unsafe Query Generation Risk in Active Record
name: CVE-2016-6317
cvss: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N
cwe: ''
cve: 2016-6317

owasp: A9
release_date: 2016-08-11
kind: :dependency_check
message: Due to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with the
  way that JSON parameters are parsed, it is possible for an attacker to issue unexpected
  database queries with “IS NULL” or empty where clauses. This issue does not let
  an attacker insert arbitrary values into an SQL query, however they can cause the
  query to check for NULL or eliminate a WHERE clause when most users wouldn’t expect
  it.
remediation: Please upgrade activerecord gem to version 4.2.7.1. Please note that
  versions 5.0.0 or later are not affected.
