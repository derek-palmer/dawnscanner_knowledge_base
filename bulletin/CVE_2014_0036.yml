message: rbovirt Gem for Ruby contains a flaw related to certificate validation. The
  issue is due to the program failing to validate SSL certificates. This may allow
  an attacker with access to network traffic (e.g. MiTM, DNS cache poisoning) to spoof
  the SSL server via an arbitrary certificate that appears valid. Such an attack would
  allow for the interception of sensitive traffic, and potentially allow for the injection
  of content into the SSL stream.
remediation: Please upgrade rbovirt version at least to 0.0.24. As a general rule,
  using the latest version is recommended.
