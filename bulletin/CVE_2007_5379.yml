message: Rails before 1.2.4, as used for Ruby on Rails, allows remote attackers and
  ActiveResource servers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and read arbitrary
  XML files via the Hash.from_xml (Hash#from_xml) method, which uses XmlSimple (XML::Simple)
  unsafely, as demonstrated by reading passwords from the Pidgin (Gaim) .purple/accounts.xml
  file.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 1.2.4 or higher. As a general
  rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
