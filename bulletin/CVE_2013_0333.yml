message: lib/active_support/json/backends/yaml.rb in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x before 2.3.16
  and 3.0.x before 3.0.20 does not properly convert JSON data to YAML data for processing
  by a YAML parser, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, conduct
  SQL injection attacks, or bypass authentication via crafted data that triggers unsafe
  decoding, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-0156.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 2.3.16 or 3.0.20. As a general
  rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
