message: sfpagent Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered as JSON[body] input
  is not properly sanitized when handling module names with shell metacharacters.
  This may allow a context-dependent attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
remediation: Please upgrade sfpagent version at least to 0.4.15. As a general rule,
  using the latest stable version is recommended.
