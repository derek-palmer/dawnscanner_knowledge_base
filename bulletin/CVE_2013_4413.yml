message: Wicked Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is due to the program failing to
  properly sanitize input passed via the 'the_step' parameter upon submission to the
  render_redirect.rb script. This may allow a remote attacker to gain access to arbitrary
  files.
remediation: Please upgrade wicked version up to version 1.0.1.
