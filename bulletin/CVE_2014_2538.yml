message: rack-ssl Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a reflected cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the program does not validate input
  passed via error messages before returning it to users. This may allow a context-dependent
  attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script
  code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser
  and the server.
remediation: A new version for rack-ssl version it has been released. Pleas upgrade
  at least to version 1.3.4 or higher.
