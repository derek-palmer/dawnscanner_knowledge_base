message: The thoughtbot paperclip gem before 4.2.2 for Ruby does not consider the
  content-type value during media-type validation, which allows remote attackers to
  upload HTML documents and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a spoofed
  value, as demonstrated by image/jpeg.
remediation: Please upgrade paperclip gem to latest version.
