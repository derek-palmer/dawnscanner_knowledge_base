message: http Gem for Ruby contains a flaw related to certificate validation. The
  issue is due to a failure to call the OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#post_connection_check
  method, leading to hostnames not being properly verified. By spoofing the TLS/SSL
  server via a certificate that appears valid, an attacker with the ability to intercept
  network traffic (e.g. MiTM, DNS cache poisoning) can disclose and optionally manipulate
  transmitted data.
remediation: Please upgrade http gem version at least to 0.8.0. As a general rule,
  using the latest stable version is recommended.
