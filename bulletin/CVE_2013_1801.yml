message: The httparty gem 0.9.0 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict casts
  of string values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct object-injection
  attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU
  consumption) by leveraging Action Pack support for YAML type conversion, a similar
  vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
remediation: Please upgrade httparty gem to version 0.9.0 or latest version available
