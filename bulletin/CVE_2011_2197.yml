message: The cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention feature in Ruby on Rails 2.x before
  2.3.12, 3.0.x before 3.0.8, and 3.1.x before 3.1.0.rc2 does not properly handle
  mutation of safe buffers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
  XSS attacks via crafted strings to an application that uses a problematic string
  method, as demonstrated by the sub method.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 2.3.12, 3.0.8, 3.1.0. As a general
  rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
