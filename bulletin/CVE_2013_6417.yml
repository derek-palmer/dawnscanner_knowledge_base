message: 'actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.16
  and 4.x before 4.0.2 does not properly consider differences in parameter handling
  between the Active Record component and the JSON implementation, which allows remote
  attackers to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks
  or trigger missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request that leverages (1) third-party
  Rack middleware or (2) custom Rack middleware. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because
  of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-0155.'
remediation: Please upgrade rails to version 3.2.16 or 4.0.2. As a general rule, using
  the latest stable version is recommended.
