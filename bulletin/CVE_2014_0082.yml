message: actionpack/lib/action_view/template/text.rb in Action View in Ruby on Rails
  3.x before 3.2.17 converts MIME type strings to symbols during use of the :text
  option to the render method, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (memory consumption) by including these strings in headers.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 3.2.17. As a general rule, using
  the latest stable rails version is recommended.
