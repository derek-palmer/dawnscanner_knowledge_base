message: rest-client Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in abstract_response.rb related
  to the handling of set-cookie headers in redirection responses that allows a remote,
  user-assisted attacker to conduct a session fixation attack. This flaw exists because
  the application, when establishing a new session, does not invalidate an existing
  session identifier and assign a new one. With a specially crafted request fixating
  the session identifier, a context-dependent attacker can ensure a user authenticates
  with the known session identifier, allowing the session to be subsequently hijacked.
remediation: Please upgrade rest-client gem version to 1.8.0 or later.
