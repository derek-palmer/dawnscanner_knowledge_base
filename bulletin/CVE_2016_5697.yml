release_date: 2016-06-24
kind: :dependency_check
message: ruby-saml prior to version 1.3.0 is vulnerable to an XML signature wrapping
  attack in the specific scenario where there was a signature that referenced at the
  same time 2 elements (but past the scheme validator process since 1 of the element
  was inside the encrypted assertion).
remediation: Please upgrade ruby-saml gem to version 1.3.0 which implements 3 extra
  validations to mitigate this kind of attack.
