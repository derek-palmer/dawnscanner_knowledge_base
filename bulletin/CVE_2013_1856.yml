message: The ActiveSupport::XmlMini_JDOM backend in lib/active_support/xml_mini/jdom.rb
  in the Active Support component in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x and 3.1.x before 3.1.12 and
  3.2.x before 3.2.13, when JRuby is used, does not properly restrict the capabilities
  of the XML parser, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or cause
  a denial of service (resource consumption) via vectors involving (1) an external
  DTD or (2) an external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 3.1.12 and 3.2.13. As a general
  rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
