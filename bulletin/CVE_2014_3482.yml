message: Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that may allow carrying out an SQL injection
  attack. The issue is due to the PostgreSQL adapter for Active Record not properly
  sanitizing user-supplied input when quoting bitstrings. This may allow a remote
  attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database, allowing
  for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 3.2.19. As a general rule, using
  the latest stable version is recommended.
