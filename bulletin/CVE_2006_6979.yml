message: The ruby handlers in the Magnatune component in Amarok do not properly quote
  text in certain contexts, probably including construction of an unzip command line,
  which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters.
remediation: It seems there is no real workaround but not using amarok in your project.
  If it's needed, please sanitize your code before passing input to Magnatune component
