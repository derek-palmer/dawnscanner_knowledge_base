kind: :unsafe_dependency_check
message:|-
	There is a possible XSS vulnerability in all rails-html-sanitizer gem versions below 1.0.4 for Ruby. The gem allows non-whitelisted attributes to be present in sanitized output when input with specially-crafted HTML fragments, and these attributes can lead to an XSS attack on target applications. This issue is similar to CVE-2018-8048 in Loofah. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.
