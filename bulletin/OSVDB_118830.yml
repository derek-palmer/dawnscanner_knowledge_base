message: Doorkeeper Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in lib/doorkeeper/engine.rb. The
  issue is due to the program storing sensitive information in production logs. This
  may allow a local attacker to gain access to sensitive information.
remediation: Please upgrade doorkeeper gem version at least to 2.1.2. As a general
  rule, using the latest stable version is recommended.
