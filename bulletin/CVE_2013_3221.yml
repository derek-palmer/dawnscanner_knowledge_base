message: The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x, 3.0.x, 3.1.x, and 3.2.x
  does not ensure that the declared data type of a database column is used during
  comparisons of input values to stored values in that column, which makes it easier
  for remote attackers to conduct data-type injection attacks against Ruby on Rails
  applications via a crafted value, as demonstrated by unintended interaction between
  the "typed XML" feature and a MySQL database.
remediation: Please upgrade rails version at least to 2.3.16, 3.2.9, 3.1.9 or 3.0.21.
  As a general rule, using the latest stable rails version is recommended.
