message: There is a XSS vulnerability on Simple Form's label, hint and error options.
  When Simple Form creates a label, hint or error message it marks the text as being
  HTML safe, even though it may contain HTML tags. In applications where the text
  of these helpers can be provided by the users, malicious values can be provided
  and Simple Form will mark it as safe.
remediation: Please upgrade Simple Form the 3.0.1 and 2.1.1 releases are available
  at the normal locations.
